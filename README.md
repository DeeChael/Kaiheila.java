# Kaiheila.java (WIP)
## A java sdk for kaiheila bot

Still in developing\
This is a fork of https://github.com/FightingGuys/rabbit and its forked branch https://github.com/Kamikuz/rabbit-enhanced\
but this fork is more like khl.py (python sdk): https://github.com/TWT233/khl.py


### Actually this SDK can be used already, but I' m making it more useful!
